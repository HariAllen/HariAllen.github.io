Who am I?

I am Hari Allen, born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I moved to Lebanon, PA on my last year of middle school, and would become a Lebanon Highschool graduate and currently enrolled at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology(This part will be updated accordingly). During my junior year in highschool, I was't sure what I wanted to do after highschool. I took a Python coding class by chance and have been fascinated by the world of programming ever since.

What I have done

Because of my late introduction to coding, along with not having my own personal computer until I was 18, I don't have many accomplishments in the way of coding. What I do have, however, are my skills in working as a team and being a leader from my time as a Football and Track and Field Captain in highschool, along with being one of the top students in my year. This would help me land a summer job Lebanon High's Tech Department, which you can learn more from my Resume link above.
