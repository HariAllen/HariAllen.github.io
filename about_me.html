    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>
      I am Hari Allen, born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I moved to Lebanon, PA on my last year of middle school,
      and would become a Lebanon Highschool graduate. Currently enrolled at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.

      During my years in highschool, I was't sure what I wanted to do after I graduate. I took a Python
      programming class by chance and have been in love with coding ever since!
    </p>

    <h2>What I have done</h2>

    <p>
      Because of my late introduction to coding, along with not having my own personal computer until mid 2020,
      I don't have many accomplishments in the way of coding. What I do have, however, are my skills in working
      as a team and being a leader from my time as a Football + Track and Field Captain in highschool, along with
      being one of the top academic students in my class. This would help me land a summer job with the
      Lebanon High's Tech Department, which you can learn more from my Resume link above.
