Tic-Tac-Toe game

Made in the late half of my first semeter at Thaddeus Stevens with Aleks Carr, this is a working tic-tac-toe game. Here is a link for the game so you can play it (https://alekscarr.github.io/tic-tac-toe/), and here is it's code(https://github.com/AleksCarr/tic-tac-toe).

Escape The Room game

This was the first mini project that I am pretty proud, a short Escape the Room game. Here is a link for the game so you can play it. Here is it's code, and you can play it side by side(https://repl.it/@HariAllen/Escape-Room#index.js)


Both links will open on new tabs, like the resume will.


Mark-up: There is a <header> at the top of the page, with <nav> links under it. The two <div> tags will have a <img> of the project, and next to it <p> tags with the text above. Lastly, the <footer> at the bottom with the list of my contacts.
